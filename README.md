# Welcome to Showtime !
### An academic project for Intro to Software Engineering at NYIT Spring '24

## Description:
This web application recommends movie showtimes to users depending on their favorite tastes.
Users are shown actors, directors, and companies who have movies now playing in theaters. They
are then able to choose their favorites as well as their preferred cinema and time of day to
go to theaters. Additionally, users are given access to browse all movies now showing and coming
up at their favorite cinema.
